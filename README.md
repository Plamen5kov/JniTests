### What is this?
A simple java project loading a [cpp library](https://github.com/Plamen5kov/CppLibrary) that is [JNI](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/intro.html#wp9502) compatible. That means c++ methods in the [cpp library](https://github.com/Plamen5kov/CppLibrary) can be called from the java code in this application.

### How to build?
This is an eclipse project. Just open in eclipse(set up for java development) and build.

### What you might want to know.
You can experiment with the cpp code by building the [cpp library](https://github.com/Plamen5kov/CppLibrary) and puting the resulting library in `./libs` folder in the `java_test` eclipse project.
